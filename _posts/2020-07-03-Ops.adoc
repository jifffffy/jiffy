== The “Ops” in DevOps

Depending on your work environment, you may or may not be heavily involved in operations—or just Ops—which involves delivering and
running software in production. We can break this down into a number of different areas:

. Provisioning
. Configuration management
. Release management
. Monitoring and alerting
. Operating

Although you probably have some idea of what these things mean, let’s describe
them so that we’re on the same page.

=== Provisioning

NOTE: also known as *creating stuff*.

Software needs computers and
resources to run on. Ensuring there are enough computing resources available and creating them if not—is an important part of that. In fact, it’s not just
machines or instances that we need; when deploying apps to the cloud, we may
also need other physical or virtual infrastructure, such as:

- Networks, also known as virtual private clouds (VPCs)
- Network address translation (NAT) gateways
- Routers
- Firewalls
- Internet gateways
- Proxies
- Security rules

=== Configuration management
Once our raw infrastructure has been created, it
typically isn’t ready to perform its true purpose in life; it has to be configured.
For some (possibly virtual) infrastructure, such as routers or firewalls, this
means ensuring they have the right settings or rules applied. For a server, it
typically means installing the necessary software packages and dependencies
needed to run an application.

=== Release management
Most systems need regular maintenance or continued
development, which implies an ongoing need to deploy—or release—newer
versions. Typically, we’d like to be able to release easily, repeatedly at any time,
and with minimal or no impact to users of the system. This can be achieved
through automation, good tooling, and techniques such as blue-green deploys or
canary releases. Additionally, when things go wrong, the ability to roll back to a
known-good version of the software can be invaluable.

=== Monitoring and alerting
In a perfect world, our application, once deployed,
would perform as expected forever. In reality, things go wrong: servers fail,
software has bugs, our assumptions don’t hold true. Rather than bury our heads
in the sand, we proactively take steps to know the health of our software and
how well it’s functioning. This typically involves tracking health metrics for the
system and being alerted when things start to go wrong.

=== Operating
In the day-to-day running of production systems, there are some
common things we may need to do: scaling up to handle increased load, scaling
down to save costs, diagnosing and debugging issues, and generally, keeping the
lights on. Smart operations teams try to automate as much as possible to
minimize human error and free up their time so they can be proactive rather than
fighting fires.

Adopting Docker changes the way we think about many of these areas.

Take configuration management, for example. Although tools like Chef, Puppet,
or Ansible are extremely popular, their role in a containerized world is
considerably diminished. With Docker, each piece of software has its
dependencies baked into its image, isolating it from those in another container.
This dramatically simplifies the problem. Since app-level dependencies are
managed by the app itself, in its Dockerfile , configuring your infrastructure
instances is largely just a case of ensuring that Docker is installed.
