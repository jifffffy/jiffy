## JVM ecosystem
When you are dealing with Big Data tools, then surely you need to use JVM of some sort. Installation of the JVM on a Linux machine is a straightforward process. Just install, export JAVA_HOME, and you are good to go.

Technically it is true, but what if you need to manage more Java versions at once? Or maybe you need to install additional JVM languages or tools. Add to this a fresh virtual machine for each new PoC (Proof of Concept) of the new project, and you can see where I'm going.

For this issue, I present a great solution - [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/). It is a tool for managing JDK and other JVM tools and languages.

## SDKMAN Instalation

To install SDKMAN just type in the terminal:
```bash
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
```
After that open new shell or just run `source ~/.bashrc`. It is that simple!

## Installing JDKs

Now let's install JDK 8 and JDK 11. For starters lets type:

```bash 
sdk list java
```

You should see a similar table. In this case, I trimmed the table to be smaller to fit on the page. In reality, there are many more versions of JDK to choose from.
```bash
================================================================================
Available Java Versions
================================================================================
 Vendor        | Use | Version      | Dist    | Status     | Identifier
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 AdoptOpenJDK  |     | 14.0.2.j9    | adpt    |            | 14.0.2.j9-adpt      
               |     | 14.0.2.hs    | adpt    |            | 14.0.2.hs-adpt      
               |     | 13.0.2.j9    | adpt    |            | 13.0.2.j9-adpt      
               |     | 13.0.2.hs    | adpt    |            | 13.0.2.hs-adpt      
               |     | 12.0.2.j9    | adpt    |            | 12.0.2.j9-adpt      
               |     | 12.0.2.hs    | adpt    |            | 12.0.2.hs-adpt      
               | >>> | 11.0.8.j9    | adpt    |            | 11.0.8.j9-adpt      
               |     | 11.0.8.hs    | adpt    |            | 11.0.8.hs-adpt      
               |     | 8.0.265.j9   | adpt    |            | 8.0.265.j9-adpt     
               |     | 8.0.265.hs   | adpt    |            | 8.0.265.hs-adpt     
               |     | 8.0.252.j9   | adpt    |            | 8.0.252.j9-adpt     
 Amazon        |     | 11.0.8       | amzn    |            | 11.0.8-amzn         
               |     | 8.0.265      | amzn    |            | 8.0.265-amzn        
 Azul Zulu     |     | 14.0.2       | zulu    |            | 14.0.2-zulu
================================================================================
```

I recommend installing JVM from AdoptOpenJDK. Just type (the last part is taken from column *Identifier*):
```bash
sdk install java 8.0.265.hs-adpt
```
And for JDK 11 type:
```bash
sdk install java 11.0.8.hs-adpt
```

## Managing JDKs

Let's see installed versions using: `sdk list java | grep installed` . The `>>>` means a version in use.
We can change the selected version by using following command:

```bash
sdk use java <tag>
```
where `<tag>` is a version identifier (from the output of `sdk list java`) like `8.0.265.hs-adpt`.

But `use` changes only the JVM for the current shell. If we want to make a global change, type:
```bash
sdk default java <tag>
```

Let's try this:
```bash
sdk default java 8.0.265.hs-adpt
echo $JAVA_HOME
java -version
```

As we can see, it easy to change the JVM version. *Cool!*

## Installing Scala and sbt

Let's say you are using Apache Spark or Apache Flink for your Big Data project. For this, you may use Scala, a great mix of a functional and object-oriented language. The standard Scala build tool is the *sbt* (like Maven or Gradle). If we want to install them, just use the SDKMAN!

Let's see available Scala and sbt versions:

```bash
sdk list scala
sdk list sbt
```
We can install as many Scala and sbt versions as we like and change them as we did with the JDKs.
So let's install Scala 2.11 and 2.13 and newest sbt.

```bash
sdk install scala 2.13.3
sdk install scala 2.11.12
sdk install sbt 1.3.13
```

And that is it! With a single tool, we can see what is available, we can install what we need and even easily swap the versions. Such a great tool!
