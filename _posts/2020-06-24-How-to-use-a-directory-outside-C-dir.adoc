:page-excerpt: On Windows, there are some restrictions on the location of your workspace folder - here is how to work around them.

== Docker for Windows
In the native Docker for Windows, go to Settings > Share drive, and select the drive.

== Docker Toolbox
Docker Toolbox expects that your data volumes will be within C:\Users. This is because Docker has limited access to the filesystem on the host computer.

If you need your project directories to be located elsewhere, for example on your D:\ drive, you will need to take some extra steps to achieve this.

NOTE: In the steps below, we use some example names, that you should substitute for ones appropriate to your needs. They are:

- shared folder/workspace directory: D:\Projects\Divio
- shared folder name in VIrtualBox: Divio
- mount point in the Docker Machine: /homedocker/projects

*Mount an arbitrary host directory in a Docker container*

 . Stop Docker Machine if it's running, with _docker-machine_ stop.
 . In VirtualBox, add a Shared Folder: *Settings > Shared Folders > Add share* - this will be the directory where you want to locate your project, such as *D:\Projects\Divio*. Give it an appropriate Folder Name, such as Divio.
 . Restart Docker Machine, with _docker-machine start_.
 . SSH into the Docker Machine, with _docker-machine ssh_.
 . Create a directory in the machine as a mount point for the project directories, for example: *mkdir projects*. This will be */home/docker/projects* - you can verify it by running _pwd_.
 . Mount the Shared Folder you named above (Divio) at the mount point you have created: _sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=50 Divio /home/docker/projects_.

Your Docker Machine will now be able to access the files in *D:\Projects\Divio*  (shared in VirtualBox under the name Divio) as */home/docker/projects*.

== Enabling permanent access

This arrangement will only persist while the Docker Machine is still running - if you restart it, the shared directory will no longer be mounted.

You can set up permanent mounting by editing the Boot2Docker configuration.

Edit */mnt/sda1/var/lib/boot2docker/profile* (you may need to use sudo  when opening the file) and add the commands:

----
mkdir /home/docker/projects
sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=50 Divio /home/docker/projects
----

Test it by stopping and restarting the Docker Machine. Once you're back in the Docker Machine, if you run ls projects, you will see the files in *D:\Projects\Divio*.
